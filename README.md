## Context
A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

## Objective
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business.

## Observation 1:
It is clear that the American cuisine type is the most popular on the weekends followed by the Japanese, Italian, Chinese, Mexican cuisine types.

## Observation 2:
The top restaurant is Shake Shack with over 200 orders placed.

## Observation 3:
The majority of FoodHub orders are placed on the weekends.

# Recommendations
## Recommendation 1 : 
Weekend Promotions: We recommend introducing some kind of special promotion, discounts, or limited-time offers for the most popular cuisine type on weekends. This can help drive more orders during weekends and attract customers looking for specific cuisine options.

## Recommendation 2 : 
Personalized Recommendations: Utilizing customer order data and feedback to offer personalized recommendations to customers based on their preferences can potentially enhance the customer experience and encourage repeat orders.

## Recommendation 3 :
Restuarants should look into the 'French', 'Southern', 'Korean', 'Spanish', 'Vietnamese' cuisines as they were ordered the least (Perhaps something to do with the preparation?).

## Recommendation 4 :
Not much can be said about the ratings because 700+ customers didnt bother to give ratings, however we recommend maybe giving some incentives to encourage customers to give ratings.
